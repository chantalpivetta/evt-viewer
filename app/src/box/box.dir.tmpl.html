                  <p class="text_panels">The
           Evangelist and his symbol, the eagle, face each other. Their pose, as
          well as the large size of the eagle in	comparison to the evangelist, is
          intended to convey the divine inspiration passed to the human evangelist
           through his symbol. John appears to be seated. He reaches out towards
          his symbol with his left hand, which possibly supports a scroll or book.
           Traces of an inscription survive. The letters INP run upwards within
          the left border of the panel, while the letters BVM run downwards in the
           lower corner of the right border. They can most likely be reconstructed
           as the beginning and end of the Latin phrase 'In principio erat verbum'
           (In the beginning was the word), the opening line of	John's gospel.</p><p class="text_panels">This
           panel originally faced the other way, capping the west face of the
          Cross. It was placed back to front when the cross was reconstructed by
          the Rev Henry Duncan in 1823.</p></div>
          <div id="sf_transom"><h3><a onclick='presenter.goToPositionId("sf_transom")'>Transom<img src="3dlink.png"></a></h3><p class="text_panels">The
           transom has never been found. The current stone is the work of the
          mason commissioned by Duncan to reconstruct the cross in 1823. The
          carvings are masonic symbols and were supplied by Duncan, a keen
          freemason: a triangle at the centre, flanked by a whale or dolphin to
          the left and a dragon to the right.</p></div><div id="sf_archer"><h3><a onclick='presenter.goToPositionId("sf_archer")'>Lower arm: The Archer<img src="3dlink.png"></a></h3><p class="text_panels">The
           lower arm of the cross-head contains an archer drawing back his bow,
          possibly firing an arrow at the eagle originally positioned at the top
          of this face of the cross (see west face). A square pouch hangs from a
          strap below his right arm. It may be meant to represent a quiver, though
           it has also been suggested that it is a book satchel and that the
          archer should be understood as firing arrows of scripture. The archer's
          cloak flies out behind him emphasizing his dynamic pose and the force of
           his movement. The panel may relate to the words of the poem inscribed
          on the left border of the south face, where the cross describes itself
          as 'wounded with arrows'.</p></div></div><div class="tsectionB" id="tab0_section1"><h2>Cross-shaft</h2><div id="sf_visitation"><h3><a onclick='presenter.goToPositionId("sf_visitation")'>The Visitation / Martha and Mary<img src="3dlink.png"></a></h3><p class="text_panels">There
           is some debate over the subject of this panel. Some scholars believe
          that it depicts the Visitation (Luke 1:30'56), the moment at which
          Elizabeth (pregnant with John the Baptist) and Mary (pregnant with the
          Christ child) embrace, and the Baptist leaps for joy in recognition of
          Christ's divinity. Other scholars believe it represents the biblical
          sisters Martha and Mary (Luke 10:38'42), symbols of the active and
          contemplative sides of monastic life. Still others believe that it is a
          deliberate conflation of the two subjects. The concrete blocks and lower
           fragments of the panel were added by Duncan during his restoration of
          the cross. The difference in scale between the hemlines and feet in the
          lower section and the proportions and drapery of the torsos in the upper
           section may indicate that the block with the feet does not belong here
          and is, perhaps, part of a now lost monument. Unlike the other figures
          on this side of the cross, the women wear sturdy shoes or slippers.</p><p class="text_panels">The
           inscription is unique on the monument for its combination of Latin and
          runic letters. It reads ['] mar'[a] (left border); mar[ia] m[']r + (top
          border); dominn' c['] (right border). The words have been translated as
          either 'Martha and Mary worthy women', or, more problematically, 'Martha
           and Mary, mother of the Lord'.</p></div><div id="sf_christandmagdalene"><h3><a onclick='presenter.goToPositionId("sf_christandmagdalene")'>Mary Magdalene at the feet of Christ<img src="3dlink.png"></a></h3><p class="text_panels">This
           panel depicts Mary Magdalene washing Christ's feet with her tears and
          drying them with her hair (Luke 7:37'8). The Magdalene's massive hand
          and extended arm may have been meant to emphasize her gesture, and hence
           her penitence, or they may simply be the work of a second-rate carver.
          Christ stands above the Magdalene holding up a book in his covered left
          hand. His right hand was originally raised in blessing. His pose echoes
          that seen in the Christ over the beasts panel on the opposite face of
          the cross. The facial features of both figures have been hacked or worn
          away.</p><p class="text_panels">The Latin inscription surrounding the
          panel reads: + A[TT]V[LIT] [ALA]B[A]S (across the top); TRVM '
          V[NGUE]NTI '&amp; S[T]AN[S] [R]E[TR]O SECVS PEDES (down the right side);

          left side) ' CAPITIS SUI TERGEBAT (across the bottom). Translation: '+
          She took an alabaster jar of ointment, and standing behind at his feet,
          she began to wash his feet with her tears and dried them with the hair
          of her head'.</p></div><div id="sf_blind"><h3><a onclick='presenter.goToPositionId("sf_blind")'>Healing of the man born blind<img src="3dlink.png"></a></h3><p class="text_panels">Christ,
           on the left, extends his hand towards the man blind from birth (John
          9:1'8) on the right. A thin diagonal line incised in the background of
          the panel indicates that Christ's right hand may originally have held a
          wand with which to anoint the blind man's eyes. While the blind man has
          been carved in profile, Christ's body and face are turned slightly
          outwards, allowing us a better view of the miracle. The lower part of
          the panel may have been left blank by the sculptor for reasons unknown,
          or may have contained an inscription that was destroyed at a later date.
           The extension of the robes of the two figures over the border of the
          blank section of the panel is part of Duncan's restoration.</p><p class="text_panels">The
           Latin inscription in the border reads: + ET PRAETERIENS ' VIDI[T] (down
           the left side) {HOMINEM CAECVM} A NATIBITATE ' ET S{ANAVIT EVM} (down
          the right side). Translation: '+ And passing by he saw a {man blind}
          from birth and {healed him}'.</p></div><div id="sf_annunciation"><h3><a onclick='presenter.goToPositionId("sf_annunciation")'>The Annunciation (Luke 1:28)<img src="3dlink.png"></a></h3><p class="text_panels">The
           archangel Gabriel seems to be entering at the left of the panel from a
          space outside the cross. The lower part of his robe flutters behind him,
           and both it and his right foot appear to overlap the panel's left
          border. On the right, the Virgin Mary, facing out at us, holds on to her
           robe with her right hand as she shrinks slightly away from the angel in
           humility. Both figures are tall, elegant and finely carved, making this
           one of the most classicizing of the cross's panels. The hole in the
          centre of the panel may be a relic cavity (perhaps for a relic of the
          True Cross), or it may have been made at some point during the toppling
          of the cross, or during its restoration and reconstruction.</p><p class="text_panels">All
           that remains of the inscription in the border are the letters '+
          INGRESSVS ANG' (across the top border), and 'TE ['] BE (down the left
          border). It has been reconstructed as 'Ingressus angelus ad eam dixit
          ave gratia plena dominus tecum benedicta tu in mulieribus' (Entering the
           angel said to her: 'Hail full of grace, the Lord is with you; blessed
          are you among women'.)</p></div><div id="sf_crucifixion"><h3><a onclick='presenter.goToPositionId("sf_crucifixion")'>Crucifixion<img src="3dlink.png"></a></h3><p class="text_panels">Crucifixion:
           The base of the cross may originally have been sunk in the ground and
          this carving added to it when the cross was raised and moved to a new
          location. It is carved in a 9th-century style, so is clearly later than
          the rest of the carvings on the cross. At the centre is the crucified
          Christ, his head drooping to the right. Discs representing the sun and
          the moon are carved either side of the top of his cross. The figures
          standing below the cross to either side of Christ may be the Virgin Mary
           and John the Evangelist, who witnessed the Crucifixion, or they may be
          Longinus and Stephaton, the spear- and sponge-bearer.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="east_face" aria-labelledby="tab1" class="ui-tabs-panel ui-widget-content ui-corner-bottom" role="tabpanel" style="display: none;" aria-expanded="false" aria-hidden="true"><h1>North Face (now East Face)</h1><div class="scroll" style="overflow: hidden;" tabindex="5001"><div class="tsectionA" id="tab1_section0"><h2>Cross-head</h2><div id="ef_crosshead"><h3><a onclick='presenter.goToPositionId("ef_crosshead")'>Cross-head<img src="3dlink.png"></a></h3><p class="text_panels">There

          in-fill. Two fragments of the original shaft remain. The inhabited
          vine-scroll of the upper fragment contains a bird and beast that nibble
          at its fruit. The inhabited vine-scroll is symbolic of both the
          tree-of-life and of the faithful partaking of the eucharist. Any
          inscription that might have surrounded the panel has been worn away. The
           lower fragment contains a small section of vine-scroll with a curling
          flower and leaf. A fragmentary inscription runs vertically down the
          border in contrast to the horizontal rows of runic characters inscribed
          on the main shaft. It reads 'd'gisg'f[.], and has never been
          convincingly translated. It has been wrongly reconstructed as part of
          lines 52b'55b from The Dream of the Rood, and thought to be a fragment
          of a personal name from a longer memorial inscription.</p></div></div><div class="tsectionA" id="tab1_section2"><h2>Lower stone</h2><div id="ef_animals"><h3><a onclick='presenter.goToPositionId("ef_animals")'>Vine Scroll<img src="3dlink.png"></a></h3><p class="text_panels">The

          the hybrid beasts intertwine with the stems of the scroll and end in
          leaf-like shapes that suggest a union of beast and scroll that may be
          meant to further their symbolic evocation of the union of the faithful
          with Christ in the eucharist, and of the words of Christ 'I am the vine;
           you the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth

          and tree together may symbolize Christ and the Cross. As it bends to

          this side was inscribed with the opening lines of his gospel, it is
          likely that the opening phrase of Matthew's gospel ('Liber generationis
          Iesu Christi'; 'The book of the generation of Jesus Christ') would have
          been inscribed in the border around this panel.</p></div></div><div class="tsectionB" id="tab2_section1"><h2>Cross-shaft</h2><div id="nf_agnusdei"><h3><a onclick='presenter.goToPositionId("nf_agnusdei")'>John the Baptist with the Agnus Dei<img src="3dlink.png"></a></h3><p class="text_panels">The
           nimbed and bearded Baptist faces frontally and holds the Lamb of God
          across his chest with his draped left hand, and points to it with his
          right. His feet rest on two globes. The outermost legs of the Lamb have
          been broken away, but originally stood free of the cross. The dimensions
           of the panel are problematic. The figure of John looks squat and the
          lines of the drapery and the panel's borders don't quite line up. Only
          fragments of the Latin inscription survive. In the lower section of the
          left border are the words '['] [A]DORAMVS (we adore), and across the
          lower border 'VT NON CVM [']' (so that not with). Its source remains
          unknown, but the third person plural voice has led to the suggestion
          that the source text may have been part of liturgical practices at
          Ruthwell.</p></div><div id="nf_worshippingbeasts"><h3><a onclick='presenter.goToPositionId("nf_worshippingbeasts")'>Christ over the beasts<img src="3dlink.png"></a></h3><p class="text_panels">The

          left hand and his right hand is raised in blessing, echoing his pose in
          the Magdalene at the feet of Christ panel on the opposite side of the
          cross. Christ rests his feet on the snouts of two beasts, which cross
          their paws in recognition of his divinity. Their crossed paws form an X,
           or chi, the first letter of his name.</p><p class="text_panels">The
          Latin inscription surrounding the panel reads: + IhS XPS IVDEX (across

           recognised in the desert the saviour of the world'. There is no one
          source for this metrical sententia, but it recalls both Psalm 90/91:13
          (Thou shalt walk upon the asp and the basilisk: and thou shalt trample
          under foot the lion and the dragon), and Habbakuk 3:2 (Between two

           slightly towards the viewer. Between them they hold a loaf of bread
          that had been miraculously delivered by a raven. The bread is a symbol
          of the eucharistic bread, the body of Christ, which is emphasized by the
           cross formed at the centre of the loaf as the two saints begin to break
           it apart. Paul and Anthony were the two earliest hermit saints, and are
           symbolic of the monastic life. They also form a male counterpart to the
           female pair of Martha and Mary at the top of the east face of the
          cross.</p><p class="text_panels">The Latin inscription that surrounds

          panel is paralleled by that of the angel Gabriel alighting in the
          Annunciation panel on the opposite face of the cross. The Christ child
          is carved on a vertical axis that aligns him with the bread held by Paul
           and Anthony, and the crossed paws of the beasts in the two panels
          above, and helps to emphasize the eucharistic symbolism of this side of
          the cross. Part of a tree, or perhaps part of the figure of Joseph is

          blocks beneath this stone were added during reconstruction. There
          appears to have been an inscription in the border of this section of the

           that suggest a union of beast and scroll that may be meant to further
          their symbolic evocation of the union of the faithful with Christ in the
           eucharist, and of the words of Christ 'I am the vine; you the branches:
           he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit' (John
           15:5). Although damaged and worn, the depth of detail of the original
          carving can still be seen in the eyes, ears and gripping paws of the
          second beast from the top. The scroll was extended beneath the lower
          border of the panel, most likely at the same time that the Crucifixion
          was added to the base of the east face. The hole in this face of the
          cross is unlikely to have been a relic cavity due to its location, and
          was almost certainly made during either the toppling or restoration and
